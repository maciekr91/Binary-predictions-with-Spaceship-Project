# Spaceship Titanic

## General info

This project is one of the Kaggle's Prediction Competitions. The goal of the project is to predict which passengers were transported into alternate dimension after spaceship collided with spacetime anomally. The final result is evaluated based on classification accuracy - the percentage of predicted labels that are correct. There are two possibilities - transported or not, so we will perform binary classification.

## Project goals

Our main goal is, obviously, achieving the best possible accuracy of prediction. As, this is educational project my goals are: 
- conducting deepened EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) including: handling missing values, finding hidden relationships beetween features and performing feature engineering,
- present the results of actions in a transparent graphical way, using mainly matplotlib and seaborn libraries,
- comparing different machine learning algorithms
